Hey there! I’m Agnes Muthiri Gachomba — a curious mind, creative thinker, and passionate software developer and cybersecurity analyst who believes code is just another form of art 🎨💻.

I love building smart, user-friendly solutions that blend functionality with creativity — from smooth interfaces to powerful backend logic. I’m always chasing that “aha!” moment when an idea comes to life through clean, elegant code.

Outside the tech world, I’m all about music, fashion, and long drives — the perfect combo for recharging my creative energy. Whether I’m debugging or daydreaming new ideas, I bring passion, precision, and a touch of style to everything I do.

Let’s create something meaningful, innovative, and a little bit magical ✨
